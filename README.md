# Nice Gadgets - Frontend Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Requirements
To work with the code, you'll need:

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - we used v14.21.3
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Getting Started

To run the project, follow these steps in your terminal:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/pl-fe-may23-codecreators/product-catalog.git

2. Open the project:

code product-catalog

3. Install dependencies:

npm install

4. Start the application in development mode:

npm start

The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can use the following scripts:

### npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you’re on your own.
#### You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
